# ✅ Sprint Review

**Project:** Student Performance Predictor – Full-Stack ML Dashboard
**Sprint Duration:** 2-Day Hackathon Sprint
**Team Size:** 2–4 Members

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Deliver a deployable ML-powered student performance prediction system with:

* Real-time predictions
* Batch CSV predictions
* Faculty analytics dashboard
* Clean UI + mobile responsiveness
* Working backend + model integration

**➡️ The sprint goal was successfully achieved.**

---

## ✨ Completed Deliverables

### 🧠 Machine Learning

* Trained Random Forest Regression model
* Achieved **94% accuracy (R² score)**
* Implemented pass/fail logic
* Implemented risk categorization
* Added model confidence calculation
* Exported model as `model.pkl`

### 🌐 Backend (Flask API)

* Built `/predict` endpoint → Real-time student prediction
* Built `/predict-csv` endpoint → Supports bulk CSV uploads
* Added student-wise output with risk + confidence
* CORS enabled for frontend communication
* Deployed backend on Render (working URL)

### 🎨 Frontend (Student + Faculty Portal)

**Single Predictor Page:**

* Input form
* Result card (score, risk, confidence)
* Quick comparison chart
* Modern UI + responsive layout

**Batch Predictor Page:**

* CSV upload UI
* Student-wise prediction table
* Error handling

**Faculty Dashboard:**

* Metrics cards (Total Students, Pass %, High-Risk Count)
* Charts:

  * Risk Level Distribution
  * Pass vs Fail
* Download-ready table
* Fully responsive and stable

### 🚀 Deployment

* Frontend deployed on Netlify
* Backend deployed on Render
* Verified end-to-end integration

## 📊 Demo Summary

During the demo, the system successfully performed:
✔ Real-time ML predictions
✔ Bulk CSV predictions
✔ Live chart generation
✔ Faculty analytics
✔ Smooth UI navigation
✔ Near-zero latency backend responses

---

## 🔍 What Went Well

* Team coordination & fast iteration
* Issues fixed quickly (CORS, deployment failures, Python version mismatch)
* Clean UI accepted by judges/mentors
* ML model performed reliably on all test cases
* Deployment stable throughout testing

---

## ⚠️ What Didn’t Go As Planned

Some optional enhancements were not completed due to time limits:

* Student name automation/embedding
* Login system (faculty + student)
* Database to store prediction history
* Advanced trend analysis charts

These were considered *“future improvements”* rather than sprint blockers.

---

## 🏁 Final Outcome

This sprint produced a fully functional, polished, ML-powered application.
It met **all major hackathon requirements**:

* ML Model → ✔
* Frontend UI → ✔
* Backend API → ✔
* Analytics → ✔
* Deployment → ✔
* Mobile support → ✔

**The sprint is considered a complete success.**

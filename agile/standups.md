# 🗓️ Daily Standup Logs

**Project:** Student Performance Predictor

# Day 1 – Standup

### ✔️ What We Completed Yesterday

* Understood problem statement
* Defined high-level architecture
* Decided ML model (Random Forest Regressor)
* Created initial project directory structure (frontend + backend)

### 📌 What We Plan To Do Today

* Generate synthetic dataset
* Train ML model and save `model.pkl`
* Build backend endpoints (`/predict`, `/predict-csv`)
* Design main UI for single student predictor

### ⚠️ Blockers

* Unsure about dataset format initially
* Needed clarity on score prediction + risk levels
* Deployment environment not yet selected
